Joggler Flash App to access the Big Oven recipe database

Written in Flash 5 which is not officially supported by the Joggler.
Uses the XML serialization format of the BigOven API as it is not possible to set the headers
to indicate JSON in Flash 5.

Some code has been left to access my own recipe API which was an experiment in server side
development in Python's Flask.
